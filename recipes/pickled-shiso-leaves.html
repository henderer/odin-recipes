    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Less of a "pickle" and more a "get in my mouth" recipe, these tangy, salty, and herbal-y ōba leaves are the perfect summer snack. When ready, place a stack on a plate and serve with rice, dried fish, nattou, or sashimi. Use your chopsticks to drop a leaf over some rice and "scoop" it into a bite-sized pillow of deliciousness. Best enjoyed on hot days with a cold beer.</p>
    <h6>Ingredients</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>20 shiso leaves ("ōba" - washed dried and stems cut) • <span lang="ja">大葉 20枚ほど</span></li>
        <li>1 clove grated garlic • <span lang="ja">おろしにんにく 1-2㎝</span></li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame seeds • <span lang="ja">白いりごま 小さじ1</span></li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar  • <span lang="ja">砂糖 小さじ1</span></li>
        <li>1/5 tsp salt • <span lang="ja">塩 小さじ1/5</span></li>
        <li>1/6 tsp chili or cayenne powder • <span lang="ja">一味唐辛子 好みで小さじ1/6ほど</span></li>
        <li>2.5 tbsp soy sauce • <span lang="ja">醤油 大さじ2と1/2</span></li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp sesame oil • <span lang="ja">ごま油 大さじ1と1/2</span></li>
        <li>1 tbsp mirin (rice wine) • <span lang="ja">みりん 大さじ1</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Steps</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all marinade ingredients together using a fork or whisk. Use a bowl that pours well. Feel free to adjust marinade ingredients to your taste! Consider adding some fresh finely minced chile for heat, or maybe a dash of rice vinegar or grapefruit juice for zing.</li>
        <li>Pour a small amount of the marinade into a pyrex bowl with a lid. Place a single leaf into the marinade, and pour a few drops of the marinade onto the leaf. Continue until all leaves are stacked in the bowl and each leaf is fully coated in marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover and refridgerate. It's ready in an hour, but I think it tastes best about 12-24 hours later.</li>
