## The Odin Project: Project #1 - Recipes

My first HTML project showcasing basic HTML skills and learning to use Git to keep snapshots of the page's development.

Step-by-Step with skills demonstrated within each iteration of this project:
1. Iteration 1: initial structure
    - create index file from terminal
    - create basic HTML content and heading "Odin Recipes"
    - commit
2. Iteration 2: recipe page
    - create "recipes" repository
    - create specific recipe page with recipe's name as h1 heading
    - add link on index page to new recipe page
    - add a link on recipe page back to index page
3. Iteration 3: recipe page content
    - add image of finished dish directly under the h1 heading
    - add "description" heading under image with 1-2 paragraphs describing recipe
    - add "ingredients" heading with unordered list
    - add "Steps" heading with ordered list
4. Iteration 4: add more recipes
    - add two more recipes (use identical page structure)
    - ensure all pages link from/to index page (use unordered list)
